# Abstract
*Background*.
Combining differentiable biomechanical modeling with Markerless Motion Capture (MMC) offers a promising approach to motion capture in clinical settings, requiring minimal equipment and effort for data collection. Currently, marker-based Optical Motion Capture (OMC) paired with biomechanical modeling is considered the most precise and accurate method for measuring human movement kinematics.

*Methods*.
This study compares key kinematic outcomes from biomechanically modeled MMC and OMC data in 15 stroke patients performing the drinking task. 

*Results*.
We observed a high level of agreement in kinematic trajectories between MMC and OMC, as indicated by high correlations between systems (median $r > 0.95$ for majority of kinematics) and median $\text{RMSE}$ values ranging from approximately $2^\circ$–$5^\circ$ for joint angles, $0.04 \, \text{m/s}$ for end-effector velocity, and $6 \, \text{mm}$ for trunk displacement). Trial-to-trial biases between OMC and MMC were consistent within patient sessions, with interquartile ranges of bias around $1-3^\circ$ for joint angles, $0.01m/s$ in end-effector velocity, and approximately $3 \, \text{mm}$ for trunk displacement. 

*Conclusion*.
Our findings indicate that MMC for arm tracking is approaching the accuracy and precision of marker-based methods, supporting its potential for use in clinical settings. MMC could provide valuable insights into movement rehabilitation in stroke patients, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies.
